Wheat head detection on GWHD_2021 dataset - PUT masters degree project.

What was done:
- [x] Analyzed and cleaned image data of wheat heads (see [here](https://github.com/JakubSzukala/jszukala-masters-degree-proj/blob/main/data/scripts/data_analysis.ipynb) and [here](https://github.com/JakubSzukala/jszukala-masters-degree-proj/blob/main/data/scripts/data_cleanup.ipynb))
- [x] Prepared Google Cloud based training of the neural network
- [x] Prepared metrics for algorithm evaluation (see [here](https://github.com/JakubSzukala/jszukala-masters-degree-proj/blob/main/model/callbacks.py) and [here](https://github.com/JakubSzukala/jszukala-masters-degree-proj/blob/main/model/utils.py))
- [x] Trained YOLOV7 neural network to detect wheat heads on image data
- [x] Created wheat density map of the area photographed with UAV with use of imagesâ€™ geolocation and other camera metadata

In the table below are presented training results. Test was performed on GWHD 2020 [test set](https://zenodo.org/record/5092309). M1 is winner model of 2020 competition, M2-M8 are models trained with Yolov7-training library and M9 and M10 are original YOLOV7 implementations from YOLOV7 paper authors.

###### Disclaimer
This was my masters project and because of time pressure I did cut some corners when it comes to good programming practices and currently I am not willing to sink more time into this project to fix this.
